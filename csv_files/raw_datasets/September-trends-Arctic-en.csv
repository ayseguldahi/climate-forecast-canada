Note: The trends presented correspond to the decadal trend over the period from 1968 to 2024. The September sea ice area trend is calculated based on average sea ice area during the month of September for each year from 1968 to 2024. A statistically significant trend is reported when the Mann-Kendall test indicates the presence of a trend at the 95% confidence level.,,,,,,
